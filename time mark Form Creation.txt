design patterns of a form
simple list and customer groups akin to retrieving a query set with objects that meet the constraints of having specific values of their fields using a GET http request method. Setup forms are like setting up a google account, or a bank account etc. which has fields that ask you for certain information, but what form pattern is this under?
setup pages are under table of contents design patterns
sub patterns - applied in a smilar manner as form patterns e.g. fields groups, image preview, fields, and custom filter, (don't forget a filter functionality is implemented through a form even in html, css, javascript). Now I understand; patterns of forms in this context is just the typical or usual ways of how users use forms to create, retrieve, update, and delete data

form properties:
view edit mode property values:
auto
view
edit

RootDatasource.AllowCreate (btw this simply means in OOP that the the our forms node/object can access the object RootDatasource and then has access to its property AllowCreate etc.)
RootDatasource.AllowDelete

Everything just has a visual interface we can now use

Learning fast:
try to watch the videos so you can have already knowledge on what the instructors are doing 
know what they discuss
look up what they discuss in the documentation because it si bound to be there
read it and get the knowledge that you can
then watch the videos again and see how they implement it, there is no need to read what is in the videos
code along with your own version
screenshot your code and save it with doodles for side notes
