time mark (menus): 

topics:
learn what you need to know then study those that you vaguely know because of time restriction deply


to extend a prebuilt in this case menu we can do it by right clicking a pre built menu in the AOT, and clicking create extension
menu artifacts
drag the created menu in the resources folder of the newly extended menu
and under dragged menu we drag under it our created menu items
a menu item button is like a navbar link or a navigation link maybe navbars in general are just menus 
clicking the run button in the IDE will launch the server that will locally host our application

Learning fast:
try to watch the videos so you can have already knowledge on what the instructors are doing 
know what they discuss
look up what they discuss in the documentation because it si bound to be there
read it and get the knowledge that you can
then watch the videos again and see how they implement it, there is no need to read what is in the videos
code along with your own version
screenshot your code and save it with doodles for side notes
