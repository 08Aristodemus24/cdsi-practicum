to extend a prebuilt in this case menu we can do it by right clicking a pre built menu in the AOT, and clicking create extension
menu artifacts
drag the created menu in the resources folder of the newly extended menu
and under dragged menu we drag under it our created menu items

clicking the run button in the IDE will launch the server that will locally host our application

Learning fast:
try to watch the videos so you can have already knowledge on what the instructors are doing 
know what they discuss
look up what they discuss in the documentation because it si bound to be there
read it and get the knowledge that you can
then watch the videos again and see how they implement it, there is no need to read what is in the videos
code along with your own version
screenshot your code and save it with doodles for side notes

2. reports: dynamics.ax.applicationplatform.0.pdb not included
possible fix:
PDB file should be in the folder K:\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory\ApplicationPlatform\bin (K is service volume disk). First, you need to check if the file from the error can be found there
if not try to compile "Application platform" model from Dynamics 365 menu
check if the option "Load symbols only for items in the solution" is unchecked from Dynamics 365 -> Options
