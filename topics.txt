topics:
learn what you need to know then study those that you vaguely know because of time restriction deply


to extend a prebuilt in this case menu we can do it by right clicking a pre built menu in the AOT, and clicking create extension
menu artifacts
drag the created menu in the resources folder of the newly extended menu
and under dragged menu we drag under it our created menu items
a menu item button is like a navbar link or a navigation link maybe navbars in general are just menus 
clicking the run button in the IDE will launch the server that will locally host our application

Learning fast:
try to watch the videos so you can have already knowledge on what the instructors are doing 
know what they discuss
look up what they discuss in the documentation because it si bound to be there
read it and get the knowledge that you can
then watch the videos again and see how they implement it, there is no need to read what is in the videos
code along with your own version
screenshot your code and save it with doodles for side notes

next keyword is akin to super() method to call the original method of the parent class
next cannot also be written inside conditional statements scopes
The next keyword behaves like a super, and it will define when your extended logic executes
The next call after your code behaves like a Pre-event handler. Your logic executes first, and later on, the logic residing in the original method gets executed


Activity 1:
-COC enabled strongly typed extension capabilities of public and protected methods
-it allows technical consultants to extend the application avoiding over-layering
-to use COC you must declare your class as final and your methods should always contain the next keyword
-only public and protected methods are allowed to be extended
-you can add custom logic that will run before and/or after the standar dcode runs
-lyou can access the protected and public methods, and variables of the base class
-you can only extend objects that are part of the referenced packages of your model. This is done through clicking the model parameters under the dynamics 365 menu, and updating the model parameters, the once in the window select the DevelopmentBasicsFMS option, next check the model we are trying to reference always e.g. CustTable for instance. This works like an import statement which adds the model that we check to our current project directory which we can always access at will
-methods with [Hookable(false)] or [Wrappable(false)] attribute cannot be extended
-methods that use the final keyword cannot be wrapped in an extension class
-class name must have an _Extension suffix
-class declaration needs to ouse the final keyword
-add the ExtensionOf attribute on the class
-use COC to extend the following: table, class, form, etc.
-the next keyword is required. This will determine on which part of the code the base class will be called

we can also use other built or even pre-built objects like tables and forms in creating extensions of them
e.g. [ExtensionOf(formStr(CustForm))] or [ExtensionOf(tableStr(CustTable))]


we can override methods of the tables we created and pre-built tables by right clicking the methods node of a table and navigating to the override method and selecting the method that we will override
this will then add our overriden method in this node and we can edit this method through x++ code

Day 5
Code extension - but what to use extensions or by clicking the override option in the tables that we have, I guess overriding the functionality of a table 

Activity 2:
- set initial value of Year to current date (I guess we can override here the this.initValue() method of a table, use today())
- add validation "year must not be greater than current date"
- add year on dialog (simple Dialog.addField(extendedTypeStr(DBFMYearTest), "year");)
- set initial value of vehicle id to the number next to the greatest value of saved vehicle ids (will probably use the select statement and pickign the max of all vehicle ids, then using this max value for the overriden initValue())
- disable editing of vehicle id on the table (this method already exists as a built in method)

Delegates allow us to access elements in higher models from a lower model. Below is a model heirarchy
Test 
Application suite
Application foundation
Application platform

exhibit a: application foundation needs something from suite, suite needs to subscribe to application foundation

(1)delegate (2)void  applyDiscountDelegate(real _receiptTotal, EventHandlerResult _result)
{
(3)
}

this is for application suite:
[SubscribesTo(classStr(Simpletax), delegateStr(SimpleTax, applyDiscountDelegate))]
public static void applyDiscountDelegateHandler(real _receiptTotal, EventHandlerResult _result)
{
	real discountedTotal = _receiptTotal * (1 - DiscountRate);
	_result.result(discountedTotal);
}

for application foundation to use application suite:
public real calculateTotalTax()
{
	real totalTax;
	
	EventhandlerResult result;
	this.applyDiscountDelegate(this.ReceiptTotal, result);
	this.ReceiptTotal = result.result();

	totalTax = this.ReceiptTotal * this.TaxRate;

	return totalTax;
}





Event handling

-is exactly like the performCreate(), onDelete(), onInsert(), componentDidMount(), componentWillMount(), events and methods that act as events in the languages you've learned like JavaScript, and Python
-we can override an event handler by creating a class
-copy the onInserting event in the CustTable table that we have included in our project via importing
-create a regular class named DBFMCustTableHandler and paste the onInserting event that we copied in the class

file: DBFMCustTableHandler.xpp
class DBFMCustTableHandler
{
	[DataEventHandler(tableStr(CustTable), DataEventType::Inserting)]
	public static void CustTable_onInserting(Common sender, DataEventArgs e)
	{
		CustTable cust_table = sender;
		if(str2int(cust_table.CreditRating) < 200)
		{
			cust_table.Blocked = CustVendorBlocked::All;
			info("the customer has been placed on hold due to low credit rating. Please review);
		}
	}
}	



-import FMRental forms by checking the FleetManagement package/model
-copy event handler onInitialized
-create another class and paste the onInitialized method
-other events are also nested in the data sources node, besides the root form node itself like OnModified, OnActivated

file: DBFMFMRentalHandler.xpp
class DBFMFMRentalHandler
{
	// under: FMRental
	[FormEventHandler(formStr(FMRental), FormEventType::Initialized]
	public static void FMRental_OnInitialized(xFormRun sender, FormEventArgs e)
	{
		info("initialized form event handler");

		FormRun form_run = sender;
		
		// access this like a tree with its nodes and subnodes
		// to gain access to the field of the form "value" itself
		FormControl fmrental_state_copy_1 = form_run.design().controlName(formControlStr(FMRental_StateCopy1));
		
		if(fmrental_state_copy_1.valueStr() == "Complete")
		{	
			fmrental_state_copy_1.enabled(false);
		}

		info(strFmt("state is initialized as: %1", fmrental_state_copy_1.valueStr()));
		
	}

	public static void FMRental_StateCopy1_OnModified(FormControl sender, FormControlEventArgs e)
	{
		//FMRental_StateCopy1 fmr_sc = sender;	
		// when valueStr() has value "complete" set the form to disabled
		if(sender.valueStr() == "Complete")
		{
			sender.enabled(false);
		}
		info("state %1 has been modified", sender.valueStr());
	}

	public static void FMRental_OnActivated(FormDataSource sender, FormDataSourceEventArgs e)
	{
		FormRun form_run = sender.formRun();
				
		// access this like a tree with its nodes and subnodes
		// to gain access to the field of the form "value" itself
		FormControl fmrental_state_copy_1 = form_run.design().controlName(formControlStr(FMRental_StateCopy1));
		
		/* if(fmrental_state_copy_1.valueStr() == "Complete")
		{	
			fmrental_state_copy_1.enabled(false);
		}
		else
		{
			fmrental_state_copy_1.enabled(true);
		} */
		
		/* // shorthand of the above
		fmrental_state_copy_1.enabled(fmrental_state_copy_1.valueStr() == "Complete" ? false : true);		
		info(strFmt("state is initialized as: %1", fmrental_state_copy_1.valueStr())); */

		FMRental fm_rental = sender.cursor();
		FormDataObject fm_rental_state = sender.object(fieldNum(FMRental, State));

		fm_rental_state.enabled(fm_rental.State != FMReservatioState::Complete);
		info(strFmt("state is initialized as: %1", fm_rental.State));		

		
	}
	
	// under: events < state < fields < FMRental < data sources < FMRental
	[FormDataFieldEventHandler(formDataFieldStr(FMRental, FMRental, state), FormDataFieldEventType::Modified)]
	public static void State_OnModified(FormDataObject sender, FormDataFieldEventArgs e)

		// because the field is an enum we must compare the field_val
		// to an enum value
		anytype field_val = sender.getValue();
		
		/* if(sender.getValue() == FMReservationState::Complete)

			sender.enabled(true);
		} */

		sender.enabled(sender.getValue() != FMReservationState::Complete);
		info(strFmt("state has been modified to: %1", sender.getValue()));
	}

	
}

-sabi na nga eh...to do this we need to go to a specific entity instance and disable the field there. Kasi wala tayo namention na specific instance so nastuck tayo sa form design lang mismo
-we need to access a specific instance, and what instance is it, yes the instances only with fields set to Complete
[<node all words with capitalized first letters>EventHandler(<node all words with capitalized first letters except first word with first lowercase first letter>Str(<...args>), <node all words with capitalized first letters>EventType::<EventType>)]
public static void <naem of the event handler or event to be overriden>(<...args>)
{

}




Activity 4:
-using event handlers disable field "Group" on all vendors form if "Group" has a value, this means that even in cases of inserting a record, updating a record, upon the loading of a record the records must be checked to see if the their group fields are blank
-disable field "UPS zone" on all vendors > invoice and delivery > Delivery if "UPS zone" has a vlaue

file: DBFMVendHandler.xpp
class DBFMVendHandler.xpp
{
	[FormDataSourceEventHandler(formDataSourceStr(VendTable, VendTable), FormDataSourceEventType::Activated)]
	public static void VendTable_OnActivated(FormDataSource sender, FormDataSourceEventArgs e)

		VendTable vend_table = sender.cursor();
		FormDataObject vend_table_fzone = sender.object(fieldNum(VendTable, FreightZone));
		vend_table_fzone.enable(!vend_table.FreightZone);
	}
}


Table Extensions
-the reason why you can't create extension is because the object whether table, form, menu is not imported yet in your project
-so add FMRental table to our project
-add the vehicle id of our DBFMVehicleTableTest to the fields
-add a primary key relation
-use set the properties like assocaiation, cardinality, relationship type and on delete to its respective values
-add a normal field to the relation and set field to vehicle id
-set the related field to the vehicle id as well

file: DBFMVendTable_Extension.xpp
[ExtensionOf(tableStr(VendTable))]
final class DBFMVendTable_Extension
{
	public void initValue()
	{
		VendGroup vendGroup;

		// ah ok because fields tables have internally no values
		// then the initValue() method is called to initialize the fields to these values
		// if there is no setting of any field then we can place next initValue() 
		// either at the top or at the bottom
		this.VendGroup = (select firstonly VendGroup from vendGroup).VendGroup;
		next initValue();

		// remember we can now dictate the behavior of the Vendtable because we have already extended it,
		// so this is the class it now uses overall and the initValue() of the base class is not anymore
		// the initValue() method being called but rather this declaration in our extension
	}

	[SysClientCacheDataMethodAttribute(true)]
	display str customVendGroup()
	{
		return "DBFM_" + this.VendGroup
	}
}


-create an extension of the VendTable form
-go to the pattern tab of the VendTable form and under the MainTab sub pattern di ko na alam kung ano add a string which will represent our custom group
-set the properties data method to the method that we made which is customVendGroup under our extended VendTable, DBFMVendTable_Extension
-set hte data source to our VendTable
-set the label to "Custom Group"



Activity 5a:
-add vehicle id field from DBFMVehicleTableTest on VendTable, and FMRental tables (do this by creating the extension first)
-Add relationship to DBFMVehicleTable cardinality: zeroone, related table cardinality: exactlyone, relationship type: association

Activity 5b:
-set label of VendGroup field on VendTable to "Vendor group" by using label files
-open table browser of VendTable to check the additional field
-open all vendors to check the updated label



Form Extensions:
-extend the FMRental form by importing it again in our project and searching it in the AOT, and create an extension of it in our project
-because we created an extension earlier of the FMRental table (correction the VendTable table) the field which is vehicle id would have been added and the relation it had to our DBFMVehicleTableTest
-we add this field to a sub pattern "info group" under the main pattern "tab details" in our design pattern tab 
-we add another data source, which will be our DBFMVehicleTableTest and set this new data source, join source property to the FMRental datasource, its allow create, delete, insert at end and edit to no
-drag the field group identification of our data source DBFMVehicleTableTest to the "tab details" > "line view" > "line view tab" > "line view header"


Activity 6:
-extend All Vendors form
-add the vehicle id field on the grid and place beside the name field of the allvendors form
-add vehicle id and VIN on invoice and delivery > delivery. After destination code
-display most recent service start date (from DBFMVehicleMaintenance) of vehicle next to VIN
-VIN must not be editable


DAY 6
Reports (sql server reporting service)

-RDP is the data source type when we add a new dataset to the report in VS
-RDP is a class that executes the business logic process the data and returns a dataset which is rendered/shown in the report
-cannot directly use a query to access the data from the database
-data has to prepare on teh basis of business logic

-consider page layout page size margins if it is pre-printed or free form when creating a report forom scratch
-pre-printed reports - already ahve a printed form layout

-create temporary table
-create contract class
-create report data provider class
-create report and report design (report needs to be deployed)
-create controller class
-create output menu item
-run report



-add a query property value to the dataset nodes element we created which is DBFMVehicleReportDS
-add new precision design under the precision design node of the report
-in the newly added precision design node right click and click edit using designer which will open up another tab where we can design the report layout shown to the user
-you can add a header or foot to the report body

Security basics

DAY 7
Data entity
Power BI


weaknesses:
difficulty wrapping my head around sql select statements, since the variable used to represent a table is used also to take in the would be value of the selected rows of a table
fields in tables and forms - by default just set the tables properties to yoru master values and then if you are going to let the user edit something or create or delete then set these on the forms object instead. Instead of always having to change the master property values of a table
overrriding methods and accessing the tables or forms within overriden methods of tables and forms
architecture of the whole system
